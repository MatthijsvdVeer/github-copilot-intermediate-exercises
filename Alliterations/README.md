# Alliterations

In this lab, you will write a program that generates alliterations. For our purposes, an alliteration is a sequence of words that all start with the same letter. For example, "amazing audacious apples" is an alliteration. We're interested in a special type of alliteration, where the alliteration combines one of more adjectives with a noun.

## Setting up your project

It's up to you to decide what type of application to build. You might opt for a simple console/terminal application. Or perhaps you're more comfortable building a web application. You can use any programming language you're comfortable with.

## Exercise 1: Generate alliterations

Write a program that accepts 1 character. This should be a letter of the Latin alphabet. The program should then create five random alliterations that start with the given letter. Each alliteration should consist of an adjective and a noun. The adjectives and nouns should be randomly selected from a list of adjectives and nouns you can find in the [word list folder][1]

```cs
// Read the "nouns.txt" file as a collection of words.
```

## Exercise 2: Generate alliterations with a specific number of adjectives

Write a program that accepts 1 character and a number. The character should be a letter of the Latin alphabet, and the number should be a positive integer. The program should then create five random alliterations that start with the given letter and contain the specified number of adjectives. Each alliteration should consist of an adjective and a noun. The adjectives and nouns should be randomly selected from a list of adjectives and nouns you can find in the [word list folder][1]
