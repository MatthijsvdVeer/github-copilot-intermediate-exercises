# GitHub Copilot Labs

Welcome to the GitHub Copilot Labs! Here you'll find a few exercises that will get you familiar with Copilot's capabilities.

These labs are language agnostic, so you can use any programming language you're comfortable with. You can complete any of them in VSCode, or an IDE that supports Copilot.

- [VSCode][3]
- [Visual Studio][5]
- [IntelliJ IDEs][1]
- [Vim/Neovim][4]

## Anagrams

[In this lab][2], you will write a program that returns all anagrams of a given word. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Amazing Alliterations

[In this lab][6], you will write a program that generates alliterations. For our purposes, an alliteration is a sequence of words that all start with the same letter. For example, "amazing audacious apples" is an alliteration.
