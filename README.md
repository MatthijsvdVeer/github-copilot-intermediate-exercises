# GitHub Copilot Labs

Welcome to the GitHub Copilot Labs! Here you'll find a few exercises that will get you familiar with Copilot's capabilities.

These labs are language agnostic, so you can use any programming language you're comfortable with. You can complete any of them in VSCode, or an IDE that supports Copilot.

- [VSCode][3]
- [Visual Studio][5]
- [IntelliJ IDEs][1]
- [Vim/Neovim][4]

## 1. Amazing Alliterations

[In this lab][6], you will write a program that generates alliterations. For our purposes, an alliteration is a sequence of words that all start with the same letter. For example, "amazing audacious apples" is an alliteration.

## 2. Anagrams

[In this lab][2], you will write a program that returns all anagrams of a given word. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Tips and tricks

- If you're stuck, try asking Copilot Chat for help. You can do this by just writing a comment in your editor with what you want to achieve. Let Copilot do the rest!
- You can always open Copilot Chat and ask for help. And remember: the better the question, the better the answer you'll get!
